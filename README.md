USEFULAPP

I do this Project for Highschool computer science final test (for the exam you can find in https://github.com/niki1729/HSExamProject) AND for FUN ;)

This App will have different features accessible by the ContentNavigationDrawer. Now I plan to implement a simple calculator (the eval process is written by me, I use the postfix form to calculate the expression), a converter and TicTacToe against a bot (written by myself).

In the future I will implement other things.

In addition, I would like to implement i18n library to change easily the language of the App (English, German, French and probably Russian).
