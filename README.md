USEFULLAPP

I do this Project for Highschool computer science final test (for the exam you can find inhttps://github.com/niki1729/HSExamProject) 
AND for FUN ;)

This App will have different features accessible by the ContentNavigationDrawer.
Now I plan to implement a simple calculator (the eval proces is written by me, I use the postpix form to calculate the expresseion), a converter and TicTacToe against a bot (written by myself).

In the future I will implement other things.

In addition, I will like to implement i18n library to change easily the language of the App (English, German, French and probably Russian).
