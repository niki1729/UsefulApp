USEFULLAPP

I do this Project for Highschool computer science final test.
This App will have different features accessible by the ContentNavigationDrawer.
Now I plan to implement a simple calculator, a converter and TicTacToe against a bot (written by myself).
In the future I will implement other things.

In addition, I will like to implement i18n library to change easily the language of the App (English, German, French and probably Russion).
